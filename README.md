Note on QT5 on Sierra
---------------------

As of writing this, QT5 (needed for capybara-webkit) doesn't install on Sierra with homebrew. See a workaround here:

https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/wiki/Installing-Qt-and-compiling-capybara-webkit#macos-sierra-1012

If you get an error like `xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance` (probably caused by Homebrew being run before installing Xcode), check the following link:

https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/569

Git
---

It is recommended to install a global .gitignore file:

`git config --global core.excludesfile [path]/.gitignore_global`

Oh My ZSH
---------

After running the script for the first time, install [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

It comes with the git plugin preinstalled, so it adds git autocompletion by default

Ruby
----

Ruby versions are handled with rbenv so any specific project has its own independent ruby version & gems

If you need the `pg` gem, in some project, compile it with the Postgres libraries included in the Postgres.app:

`gem install pg -v [gem_version] -- --with-pg-config=/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/[version]/bin/pg_config`

Post-install
------------

- Install Oh My ZSH and add plugins (TODO: add to the script to install automatically)

- Login to Chrome to sync bookmarks

- Install printers
